# Training Improvements Summary

## Problem Analysis

### Issues with Previous Training (Episode 895, 8.16% success)

1. **Premature Early Stopping**
   - Stopped at only 895 episodes with 8.16% success rate
   - Early stopping was too aggressive (min 500 episodes, 95% target, 300-episode plateau)
   - Only 210 states explored (sparse Q-table coverage)

2. **Poor Generalization**
   - Training used random points but agent didn't explore enough
   - Q-Learning with discrete states needs extensive exploration
   - Test failures: 100% collision rate, many 1-step failures

3. **Insufficient Exploration**
   - Epsilon decayed too fast (0.999 per episode)
   - Min epsilon too low (0.01) - not enough random exploration
   - Learning rate too conservative (0.2)

4. **Training/Testing Mismatch**
   - Agent learned on sparse random points
   - Test points may be in unexplored regions
   - No policy for unseen states → immediate collisions

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Early Stopping Parameters (More Conservative)

| Parameter | Old Value | New Value | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| `EARLY_STOP_SUCCESS_RATE` | 95.0% | 80.0% | More achievable target |
| `EARLY_STOP_MIN_EPISODES` | 500 | 2000 | Ensure sufficient learning |
| `EARLY_STOP_PLATEAU_EPISODES` | 300 | 500 | Longer window for improvement |
| Plateau logic | 5% improvement | 10% improvement + 50% success | Stricter criteria |

### 2. Q-Learning Hyperparameters (Better Exploration)

| Parameter | Old Value | New Value | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| `LEARNING_RATE` | 0.2 | 0.3 | Faster adaptation |
| `EPSILON_DECAY` | 0.999 | 0.9995 | Slower exploration decay |
| `EPSILON_MIN` | 0.01 | 0.05 | Maintain exploration longer |

### 3. Idle Penalty (Already Implemented)

- Penalizes standing still (idle actions)
- Threshold: linear < 0.05, angular < 0.05
- Penalty: -0.5 per idle step
- Forces agent to keep moving and exploring

### 4. Plateau Detection Logic

**Old Logic:**
```python
if improvement < 5% of early_avg:
    stop()  # Too aggressive
```

**New Logic:**
```python
if improvement < 10% of early_avg AND success_rate >= 50%:
    stop()  # Only stop if actually learning well
```

### 5. Clean Start

- Deleted old checkpoint (Episode 499, 16 successes)
- Deleted old Q-table (210 sparse states)
- Starting fresh with improved parameters

## Expected Improvements

### Training Phase (First 2000+ episodes)

1. **More Exploration**
   - Epsilon stays higher longer (0.9995 decay)
   - Minimum 5% random actions throughout
   - Will explore more diverse states

2. **Faster Learning**
   - Higher learning rate (0.3) adapts Q-values quicker
   - Should see success rate climb faster

3. **Better Coverage**
   - Should explore 500-1000+ states (vs 210 before)
   - More robust to random test positions

4. **No Premature Stopping**
   - Minimum 2000 episodes before early stop
   - Plateau needs 50% success + low improvement
   - Should train for 3000-5000 episodes

### Testing Phase

1. **Better Generalization**
   - More states explored during training
   - Higher success rate on random test points
   - Fewer immediate (1-step) collisions

2. **Target Success Rate**
   - Aiming for 60-80% on random test points
   - Should be similar to training success rate
   - If still poor, may need:
     - More episodes (increase NUM_EPISODES to 15000)
     - Coarser discretization (reduce bins)
     - Curriculum learning (start with easier tasks)

## Why robot_avoidance_ql.py Works Better

The inference script (`robot_avoidance_ql.py`) works because:

1. **Greedy Exploitation Only**
   - Uses best Q-values (no exploration)
   - More consistent behavior

2. **May Use Different Test Points**
   - If using fixed points agent trained on
   - Or agent got lucky with random points

3. **Different Success Criteria**
   - May have different termination conditions
   - Could be more lenient

## Monitoring Training Progress

Watch for these metrics:

### Good Signs
- ✅ Success rate climbing: 10% → 30% → 50% → 70%
- ✅ Q-table growing: 200 → 500 → 1000+ states
- ✅ Episode length increasing (not immediate collisions)
- ✅ Epsilon gradually decreasing but staying > 0.05

### Warning Signs
- ⚠️ Success rate stuck at < 20% after 2000 episodes
- ⚠️ Many episodes ending in 1-5 steps
- ⚠️ Q-table not growing (< 300 states at episode 1000)
- ⚠️ Early stopping before episode 2000

## Further Improvements (If Still Failing)

### Option 1: Curriculum Learning
Start with easier tasks, gradually increase difficulty:
1. Fixed start/goal points (1000 episodes)
2. Random points with larger spacing (2000 episodes)
3. Random points with full range (remaining episodes)

### Option 2: Coarser Discretization
Reduce state space complexity:
```python
POSITION_BINS = 10  # (was 15) - coarser position
DISTANCE_BINS = 8   # (was 10) - coarser distance
ANGLE_BINS = 6      # (was 8) - coarser angles
LASER_BINS = 2      # (was 3) - simpler obstacles
```

### Option 3: Better State Representation
Use more informative features:
- Distance + angle to goal (already doing)
- Closest obstacle distance + direction
- Current velocity (to penalize stopping)
- Battery level (for battery-aware navigation)

### Option 4: Advanced Techniques
- Experience replay (store transitions, sample batches)
- Reward shaping (incremental progress rewards)
- Multi-step returns (N-step Q-learning)
- Function approximation (Deep Q-Network instead of Q-table)

## Running the Improved Training

```bash
# Start fresh training with improved parameters
python3 training.py

# Monitor progress (in another terminal)
tail -f training_log.json

# Test after training
# The test is automatically run at the end
```

## Expected Timeline

- **Episodes 0-500**: Learning basics, exploring, 0-15% success
- **Episodes 500-1500**: Improving, exploring more states, 15-40% success
- **Episodes 1500-3000**: Refining policy, 40-70% success
- **Episodes 3000+**: Fine-tuning, should stabilize around 70-80% success

If success rate is still < 50% after 3000 episodes, consider the "Further Improvements" options above.
